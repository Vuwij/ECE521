\section{Euclidean distance function}
Include the snippets of the Python code.

\begin{verbatim}
def euclidianDist(a, b):
    x_z = (tf.expand_dims(a,0) - tf.expand_dims(b,1))
    return tf.transpose(tf.reduce_sum(tf.multiply(x_z, x_z), 2))
  
\end{verbatim}


\section{Making Predictions for Regression}
\subsection{Choosing the nearest neighbours}
Include the relevant snippets of your Python code.
\begin{verbatim}
def pickKNearestNeighboursUnscaled(DistMatrix, k):
    length = tf.shape(DistMatrix)[1]
    
    values, indices = tf.nn.top_k(-DistMatrix, k)
    range = tf.range(length)
    
    rangeblock = tf.expand_dims(tf.expand_dims(range, 0),0)
    indexblock = tf.expand_dims(indices, 2)
    
    truth_matrix = tf.reduce_sum(tf.to_float(tf.equal(rangeblock, indexblock)),1)

    return truth_matrix

def pickKNearestNeighbours(DistMatrix, k):
    length = tf.shape(DistMatrix)[1]
    
    values, indices = tf.nn.top_k(-DistMatrix, k)
    range = tf.range(length)
    
    rangeblock = tf.expand_dims(tf.expand_dims(range, 0),0)
    indexblock = tf.expand_dims(indices, 2)
    
    truth_matrix = tf.reduce_sum(tf.to_float(tf.equal(rangeblock, indexblock)),1)

    return truth_matrix / tf.to_float(k)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Prediction}



The best k using the validation error is k=1, which has the minimum validation MSE loss.\\

The plot shows that for k=1, there is an overfitting problem, so the curve has many wiggles, including much noise information. However, if k is too large, such as k=50, the difference between predicted y value and true y value is obvious. So in summary, k = 5 is the best.


\section{Making Predictions for Classification}
\subsection{Predicting class label}
Include the relevant snippet of code for this task.

\begin{verbatim}
def predictFinalValue(inputX, trainX, trainY, K):
    Knearest = pickKNearestNeighboursUnscaled(euclidianDist(inputX, trainX), K)
    predictionMatrix = tf.multiply(Knearest, trainY + 1)

    outputY = tf.zeros(0)    
    for i in range(0, runCount):
        y, idx, count = tf.unique_with_counts(predictionMatrix[i])
        count2 = tf.slice(count, [1], tf.shape(count)-1)
        item_class = tf.expand_dims(y[tf.argmax(count2)+1],0)
        outputY = tf.concat([outputY, item_class],0)
    
    outputY = outputY - 1
    return tf.to_int32(outputY)
\end{verbatim}
